# themis-maui-prototype
Prototype project which uses themis SecureCell in C# on iOS and android with MAUI toolchain

---

`!!! CAUTION`: the iOS bindings work only on a `REAL DEVICE` <br/>
the simulator build is crashing on start and the debugger does not attach.<br/>
P.S. I was unable to find any relevant logs to troubleshoot.
