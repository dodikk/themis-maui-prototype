# themis-maui-prototype
Prototype project which uses themis SecureCell in C# on iOS and android with MAUI toolchain


!!! CAUTION: the iOS bindings work only on a `REAL DEVICE` 
the simulator build is crashing on start and the debugger does not attach.
P.S. I was unable to find any relevant logs to troubleshoot.
